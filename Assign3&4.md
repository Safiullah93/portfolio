## Process
### Step 1: Motivation for selecting the visualization

Every year, almost like a fifth season, Smog returns to South Asia in the period between Fall and Winter and persists through the winters. This is primarily due to the worsening air quality in the region, particularly in this time period. As this 'fifth season' is returning to South Asia this year again, and the air quality index is showing consistenly the worst (highest AQI) ratings in the world, I was keen to look for visualizations that might be informing relevant policymakers in addressing this issue. While doing research I came across a visualization made by a think tank based out of New Delhi, trying to assist policymakers better understand the dynamics of the issue. The visualization shows different pollutants and the corresponding sources of pollutants contributing to the emissions.

### Step 2: Critique of the original visualization

I followed up with a comprehensive critique of a visualization that I felt obscured the primary purpose, that was to show different pollutants and their corresponding sources contributing to their emissions, by indulging in practices counter-productive to an effective and useful visualization. I was able to critique it using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile method. The critique has been recorded in the google forms.

### Step 3: Wireframing

Using the critique, I was able to wireframe and plan out the redesign the visualization. I was able to sketch the entire visualization and deliberate over the changes to be made. It was one thing to write down recommendations for changes to be made, but while sketching I was able to personally visualize the new design and improve on some of my initial recommendations or proposed changes as well. Following is the sketch made during the wireframing phase:

### Step 4: User Feedback

I used the sketch created in the wireframing phase to get feedback from two of my peers. I used the standard script shared along with the assignment, and handed the hand drawn sketch to my peers. These peers are not enrolled in Telling Stories with Data (the relevant course at Carnegie Mellon University), therefore had no idea what to expect or look for in the sketch. I was hoping for unadulterated opinions on what they thought the visualization was about, what the author hoped to achieved through it and who the intended audience was. Following are the responses:

#### Q1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
Answer 1: "Data shown in graphs describing air quality pollutants"

Answer 2: "Bar graphs for air pollutants"

#### Q2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Answer 1: "Graphs showing the emissions of four pollutants and their sources"

Answer 2: "The sources of air pollutants and how much each of them contributes to the emissions of the pollutants"

#### Q3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Answer 1: "Residential source being the highest contributor of two of the pollutants is surprising. And so are transport emissions being low for three of the pollutants as well"

Answer 2: "Surprised to find agricutural burning to have such low emission compared to other sources for PM 2.5. Stubble burning contributing to poor air quality is a huge political discussion in India"

#### Q4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Answer 1: "Can be the persons responsible for environment control or taking action against air pollution" 

Answer 2: "Policymakers and general public"

#### Q5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Answer 1: "The header can be improved to summarize the information in a better way"

Answer 2: "Identify clearly somewhere that pm2.5, pm10, etc are pollutants affecting air quality"

## Summary

I started the redesign by reviewing the critique I had done using the Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness profile method. The critique was able to help me in the wireframing the redesign phase, where I hand-sketched the new design. The new design focused on bringing clarity to the visualization in terms of its primary purpose - that was to show the sources of pollutants that contribute to the emissions of the pollutants. The idea being to make it easier for the primary audience of the visualization - policymakers and relevant government institutions - to understand and address the issue of deteriorating air quality in India in 2006.
The first few drafts I created included all four pollutants in the dataset that contribute to the deteriorating air quality. There was a distinct colour for every source of pollutant to allow for easy demarcation. The results were decent but still appeared to be covering too much in a single visualization, and obscuring the key idea. So I was able to complement the data with research that indicated that two of the four pollutants - PM 2.5 & PM 10 - required much more attention since they contributed much more the worsening air quality. So in the following draft I was able to reduce the pollutants of interest to two, so I went from 4 to 2 bar graphs. Secondly, I was able to recognize the two highest contributing sources of PM 2.5 and PM 10 emissions in India and give them colours that would allow them to stand out while ensuring the colours appeared to have some negative connotations as well (avoid using positive colours like green and blue). The bars for the remaining sources of pollutants were turned grey to allow for comparison but focus to remain on the two highest contributors (Residential and Industry).
The final draft has a descriptive header describing the role played by the two highest contributing sources of PM 2.5 and PM 10 in India, in 2006. The visualization focuses on PM 2.5 and PM 10 pollutants and the highest contributng sources (Residential and Industry), while keeping the remaining information in the visualization to allow for an easy comparison with other sources. Colours have also been assigned to allow for the focus in the manner discussed earlier. Finally, footers have been equipped with sources to the data and the rationale used for converting the initial visualization to the new redesigned one.
