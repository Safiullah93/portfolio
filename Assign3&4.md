# Critique by Design: Pollutants contributing to Air Quality deterioration in India

## Original Data Visualization

## Process
### Step 1: Motivation for selecting the visualization

Every year, almost like a fifth season, Smog returns to South Asia in the period between Fall and Winter and persists through the winters. This is primarily due to the worsening air quality in the region, particularly in this time period. As this 'fifth season' is returning to South Asia this year again, and the air quality index is showing consistenly the worst (highest AQI) ratings in the world, I was keen to look for visualizations that might be informing relevant policymakers in addressing this issue. While doing research I came across a visualization made by a think tank based out of New Delhi, trying to assist policymakers better understand the dynamics of the issue. The visualization shows different pollutants and the corresponding sources of pollutants contributing to the emissions.

### Step 2: Critique of the original visualization

I followed up with a comprehensive critique of a visualization that I felt obscured the primary purpose, that was to show different pollutants and their corresponding sources contributing to their emissions, by indulging in practices counter-productive to an effective and useful visualization. I was able to critique it using Stephen Few's Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile method. The critique has been recorded in the google forms.

### Step 3: Wireframing

Using the critique, I was able to wireframe and plan out the redesign the visualization. I was able to sketch the entire visualization and deliberate over the changes to be made. It was one thing to write down recommendations for changes to be made, but while sketching I was able to personally visualize the new design and improve on some of my initial recommendations or proposed changes as well. Following is the sketch made during the wireframing phase:

### Step 4: User Feedback

I used the sketch created in the wireframing phase to get feedback from two of my peers. I used the standard script shared along with the assignment, and handed the hand drawn sketch to my peers. These peers are not enrolled in Telling Stories with Data (the relevant course at Carnegie Mellon University), therefore had no idea what to expect or look for in the sketch. I was hoping for unadulterated opinions on what they thought the visualization was about, what the author hoped to achieved through it and who the intended audience was. Following are the responses:

#### Q1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
Answer 1: "Data shown in graphs describing air quality pollutants"

Answer 2: "Bar graphs for air pollutants"

#### Q2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
Answer 1: "Graphs showing the emissions of four pollutants and their sources"

Answer 2: "The sources of air pollutants and how much each of them contributes to the emissions of the pollutants"

#### Q3. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Answer 1: "Residential source being the highest contributor of two of the pollutants is surprising. And so are transport emissions being low for three of the pollutants as well"

Answer 2: "Surprised to find agricutural burning to have such low emission compared to other sources for PM 2.5. Stubble burning contributing to poor air quality is a huge political discussion in India"

#### Q4. Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Answer 1: "Can be the persons responsible for environment control or taking action against air pollution" 

Answer 2: "Policymakers and general public"

#### Q5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Answer 1: "The header can be improved to summarize the information in a better way"

Answer 2: "Identify clearly somewhere that pm2.5, pm10, etc are pollutants affecting air quality"
