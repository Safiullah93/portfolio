This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data course with Prof. Goransson @ Carnegie Mellon University.

# About me
This is Raja Safiullah, current MS Public Policy and Management - Data Analytics pathway student at Heinz College, Carnegie Mellon University. 

# What I hope to learn
I am hoping to work on my data visualization skills, to complement my keen interest in data analytics and data science. I was trained by a management consulting firm where there is a significant focus on data visualizations and storytelling. I feel I was exposed to great deal of discipline in the use of colours and generally storytelling using analysis on powerpoints. Now I wish to acquire the skills required to work on more widely used tools for visualizations in data science and BI, as I transition into a more technical professional career. My hope is that this course will provide me this opportunity.
