# Final Project - Part III

Here is a [link](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/the-hungry-and-the-ultra-rich/index.html#group-section-COVID-Pandemic-8uN5m28W4q) to the Final Story, titled: 'The Hungry & the Ultra-Rich: The Pandemic & the Fortunes of the Two Ends of the Spectrum'.

The Part III of the final project was about finalizing the general story, figuring out the issues in flow, making it relevant to the audience and introducing a viable or working call of action. The tool used for the story was Shorthand, along with flourish primarily used for building data visualizations and infogram used for buidling inforgraphics. Where information from external sources was used, it was appropriately cited within the story on Shorthand to allow for ease in navigating through the works cited.

Following are some of the challenges I faced while working on Part III, that are worthy of discussion to better understand how the story transformed into a comprehensive whole. 

## Target Audience

One of the challenges I faced while trying to visualize this story was understanding who my audience would be for it. Since I could expect that to not just have a bearing on my call of action, but all of my story. I felt by restricting my audience either just the Ultra-rich or the common people, I would be leaving out something key aspect about my story. So in Part III, I was finally able to strike that balance, where the story could resonate with both sets of my intended audiences. There was information that one could imagine would be an eye opening experience for both sets of the audience, and visualizations that would have them hooked from the start.

## Call to Action

Pertinent to reflect on the call to action in the same breath. The two sets of audiences that are worlds apart, meant that a single call to action would not have made sense. So I opted to proceed with the option of offering the opportunity to make donations to United Nations World Food Program, which has been at the forefront of transnational efforts of resolving world food insecurity that would allow for those in the position to giveback, do so in a seamless manner after reviewing the story. At the same time, I put thought into how I could engage with common people anywhere along the socio-economic spectrum who might also feel concerned with the trends after reviewing the story and would be motivated to act. For these individuals I offered the link to a Petition connected to the Ultra-Millionaire Tax Act proposed in the US Congress - asking for 0.05% Richest in the US to be taxed appropriately, in light of their gains during the pandemix where the rest of the population was for the most part struggling economically. This combination of philanthropy and activism felt like the appropriate domains to request action within from my audience. 

## Visualizing key elements

One challenger I faced while building the story was visualizing the disparity between the Ultra-rich and the Hungry, and what exactly would it take from the former to resolve the food insecurity faced by the latter. I wanted a visualization that not only captured the disparity but was interactive in the sense that you could hover over it and get the exact figures to give nuance to the story. I was able to create circles within circles, which were drawn to scale and perfectly captured the disaprity and also contained key information like the Wealth of the Richest and the proportion required to reesolve Severe and Moderate Food Insecurity. 

Another visualization I was keen on making easier to digest for the audience, was the growth of Wealth of the Richest and the prevalence of World Food Insecurity before and during the Pandemic. I opted for racing line charts that showed the percentage growth in both the indicators, and showed a clear shift to a new space as soon as we entered the time period representing the pandemic to allow for ease in comparison. 

I also wanted to make the story more humane, and less about "statistics alone". So I chose to represent the state of Severe and Moderate Food Insecurity in terms of ratio, where instead of using just numbers I used avatars to drive the idea home that these were humans we were discussing. This was included in the inforgraphic I built, and I was delighted with the flexibility offered towards this end by the Infogram tool I used for this.

## Flow of the story

Finally, I was also concerned about the flow of the story. I changed the positioning of visualizations and sections a number of times and used my user research to better understand how I could best deliver my intended message. The User Research was of great help for me in this case, as my users were able to rightly point out when and where the story seemed disjointed or if there appeared to be any jumps. After taking in the feedback, I was able to start by building context for the situation by discussing pre-pandemic situation, follow it up with the current state, and then discuss what could be done about the identified situation - with the final section flowing seamlessly into the final call of action.

## Concluding remarks

Working on this project meant a steep learning curve for me, while I was exposed to a number of tools for the first time. I am pleased that I was able to challenge myself by trying new and different visualization types that had not been covered in the lectures, and how it gave me the confidence to explores new tools that were also not covered in the lectures. Credit to the course, especially the way it has been designed that I was able to leverage my learning of new features and tools and use them effectively to communicate my story.
