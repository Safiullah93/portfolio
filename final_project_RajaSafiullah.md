# Project Proposal I

This project explores the scale of World Hunger in 2021 in light of the increase in disparity and fortunes of the ultra-rich of the world, with a special focus on COVID pandemic's impact.

## Background

Global Hunger is a problem for the world that has persisted since time immemorial. The formation of Transnational bodies like United Nations has allowed for a global collaborative effort to address the issue. In the age where there is theoretically enough to feed everyone, yet there still remain approximately 811 million people affected by hunger. While there was good progress being made on this front since 2000, due to a collaboration of United Nations and Civil Society across the world with a commitment to "eliminating extreme poverty and hunger" as per the Millenium Development Goals, there appears to be a reversal of trends with the on-set of COVID pandemic. Another debate that appears in parallel to the responsibility of the international community, is the possible contribution of the richest people in the world who in some cases have seen their fortunes increase in an otherwise difficult economic situation brought about by the pandemic. 

## Motivation

On Oct 26, 2021 David Beasley - Director of United Nation's World Food Programme stated to CNN that now was the time for the ultra-rich to step up in the fight against global hunger. In doing so, he name-dropped the newly crowned richest person in the world Elon Musk. And categorically stated that Elon Musk alone could solve the world hunger in a one-time assistance, by only allocating a fraction of his total worth. Elon Musk was quick to respond, in inquiring how such a feat would be possible. And if it was possible, he was willing to "sell Tesla's shares right away" to generate the said amount. 
This got me thinking about the disparity our socio-economic systems have given birth to, epitomized by a world struggling with hunger when the richest keep getting richer beyond comprehension. This story has a better chance of catching the attention of the audience, if it was successfully visualized and not just spelled out.

## Outline

### A. Food Insecurity has worsened during COVID, contrary to the improvement noted pre-COVID
This graph splits the time into pre-covid and during covid to show that the positive trend in terms of improvement (reduction) in food insecurity, noted prior to the on-set of COVID pandemic, has reversed during COVID. Suggesting there is an urgent need to address the worsening issue.

### B. Wealth of the Ultra-rich has grown at an even faster rate During COVID, compared to pre-COVID
This graph also splits the time into pre-covid and during covid, to show how the wealth of the Ultra-rich/richest in the world has grown at an even faster rate during COVID pandemic.

### C. Approximately 6% Wealth of Elon Musk (the richest) required to feed the food insecure, per year
This visualization attempts at showing the proportion of the wealth required of the Richest person as of now 2021 (Elon Musk) to address world hunger, annually.

### D. Less than 1% Wealth of the Richest 1% required to feed the food insecure, per year
This visualization attempts at showing the proportion of the wealth required of the Richest 1% of the world in 2021 (Elon Musk) to address world hunger, annually.

### E. Call to action
If the richest are intent on helping the world recover from COVID, and once and for all putting an end to the issue of food insecurity - that should be unimaginable in the age of supposed prosperity of the few that is incomprehensible - then they clearly have the resources at their disposal and can utilize the mechanims in place in the form of transnational bodies to end world hunger.

## Data

### 1) United Nations - Department of Economics & Social Affairs

Here is a [link](https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/unsdg).
The Department of Economics & Social Affairs maintains the database on the Sustainable Development Goals indicators. The relevant SDG indicator is the 2.1.2 Severity of Food Insecurity. This data set covers country wise and global Food Insecurity trends from 2014 to 2020.
The data will primarily be used for charting the trends of world food insecurity over time.

### 2) Food & Agriculture Microdata Catalogue (FAM) - Food & Agriculture Organization of United Nations (FAO)

Here is a [link](https://microdata.fao.org/index.php/catalog/Food-Security).
The Food and Agriculture Organization of United States mainatins data on the Food Insecurity at the micro-level, in the Food & Agriculture Microdata Catalogue (FAO).
The data will be used for complementing the UN DES dataset, for charting the trends of world food insecurity over time.

### 3) The World Ultra Wealth Report 2021 - Wealth-X

Here is a [link](https://go.wealthx.com/world-ultra-wealth-report-2021).
Wealth-X is an organization that specializes in leveraging the data on wealthiest in the world to assist them and their partners in the business processes. The database access is restricted to clients only. There is nevertheless a World Ultra Wealth Report 2021 that shares the key findings and discusses the growth of fortunes of the wealthiest in the world.
The data will be used for understanding the trends of growth in wealth of the Richest in the World.

### 4) Real-time Billionaires - Forbes

Here is a [link](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/#50762b863d78).
Forbes is a leading global media house that is renowned for compiling the list of the richest and their worth, in real-time. The trends in terms of growth of fortunes of the richest can also be viewed on Forbes. 
The data will be used for understanding the scale of the wealth held by the Richest in the World.

### 5) Cost to end world Hunger - Borgen Project

Here is a [link](https://borgenproject.org/cost-to-end-world-hunger/).
Borgen Project is a non-profit think-tank engaged with improving the understanding of social issues and informing the relevant stakeholders engaged in policy-making.
The data will be used for understanding the cost of resolving world hunger (Per year in this case).


## Method and Medium

I will primarily be using Shorthand to build the story. Some of the visualizations will be charts that are depicting the increase food insecurity trend during covid, compared to pre-covid. Another graph to show the increasing trend in the growth of wealth of the richest during the COVID compared to pre-covid. This will be done to show build context for the visualizations to follow.
I have currently used two large circles with much smaller circles to show the visualizations for proportion of wealth required to resolve world hunger, annually. I will try to draw them according to scale, and if I feel that the visualization isn't doing justice to the point that I am trying to make then I will entertain unconventional visualizations i.e. not charts. 
I would like to use tableau for the visualizations since I am keen on learning more about the tool. But where there are limitations I am open to using Flourish - which I feel much more comfortable using now - or R - which I have some experience in already for visualizations.
