# The Hungry and the Ultra-rich - understanding the scale

## Executive Summary

Global Hunger is a problem for the world that has persisted since time immemorial. The formation of Transnational bodies like United Nations has allowed for a global collaborative effort to address the issue. In the age where there is theoretically enough to feed everyone, yet there still remain approximately 811 million people affected by hunger. While there was good progress being made on this front since 2000, due to a collaboration of United Nations and Civil Society across the world with a commitment to "eliminating extreme poverty and hunger" as per the Millenium Development Goals, there appears to be a reversal of trends with the on-set of COVID pandemic. Another debate that appears in parallel to the responsibility of the international community, is the possible contribution of the richest people in the world who in some cases have seen their fortunes increase in an otherwise difficult economic situation brought about by the pandemic. This project explores the scale of the issue in light of the increase in disparity and fortunes of the uber-rich of the world. 

## Motivation

On Oct 26, 2021 David Beasley - Director of United Nation's World Food Programme stated to CNN that now was the time for the ultra-rich to step up in the fight against global hunger. In doing so, he name-dropped the newly crowned richest person in the world Elon Musk. And categorically stated that Elon Musk alone could solve the world hunger in a one-time assistance, by only allocating a fraction of his total worth. Elon Musk was quick to respond, in inquiring how such a feat would be possible. And if it was possible, he was willing to "sell Tesla's shares right away" to generate the said amount. 
This got me thinking about the ridiculous disparity our socio-economic systems have given birth to, epitomized by a world struggling with hunger when the richest keep getting richer beyond comprehension. This story had a better chance of catching the attention of the audience, if it was successfully visualized and not just spelled out.
