## Comparison of visualization methods
Firstly I started off with a bar-graph allowed for a country wise comparison in terms of the ratios - the higher the ratio, the bigger the bar. The first limitation was that it could only be realistically be done for a year while retaining clarity. Secondly, the bars were slighly misleading, as we could not tell if a bigger or a smaller bar was better. Thirdly, since all the bars were grey it was not obvious how each country was faring in 2020. The second visuaization was done through country-wise grid line-graphs, that showed the trends of GDP-to-Debt ratio over time for every country individually (for all those that data was available). This form of visualization was best suited for looking at countries in isolation, but did not help much with a comparison. 
The third visualization was chosen because it able to show what a 'good' GDP-to-Debt ratio (according to Euro convergence criteria) through a colour scheme - with blue depicting good and red depicting bad. Secondly, it also allowed for seeing the change in trends over time as we played the visual from 1995 to 2019 showing how the colour changed for countries over time. Lastly, the countries for which we had missing numbers were in grey, so they were out of focus.
