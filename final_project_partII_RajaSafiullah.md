# Final Project - Part II

## Storyboard and wireframing

Here is the [link](https://preview.shorthand.com/QBL9Hq3ECPIsIYUz?_gl=1*2l11u*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2MzcwOTUyMzEuQ2owS0NRaUF5czJNQmhET0FSSXNBRmYxRDFjM1RUay1sV1hSa1Vwd09MZlBpZGZFQzVXVmo5X0hlb2RWUTIzTzVUNUh2MS1EQldZRUNrNGFBaEd0RUFMd193Y0I.) for the Storyboard. For the storyboard, I used Shorthand. The primary reason for using shorthand was that it allows for a nice way to put placeholders for text, images, and visualizations, and try to get a better sense of how the story might flow and appear to my audience. This helped me a lot with my user research, where all the story could be seen in its entirety and allow my audience to easily respond to it. 

## User Research

### Target Audience

The target audience of the story are common people for me who have the ability mobilize and voice concern over the ever-increasing disparity in fortunes of the richest and the most vulnerable in the world. The idea was to show to them how much of an impact the richest can make in the lives of the common people across the world, with an almost insignificant proportion of their wealth. And if there is a conviction on their part to make a positive contribution in terms of resolving world food insecurity, then there is minimal effort required form their end. My audience can be better informed on this situation, and act accordingly to possibly stimulate positive action from the richest in the world.

### Approach to identifying individuals to interview

The approach was to look for individuals who might already be socially active and interested in social issues like World Food Insecurity. Secondly, a better measure for the effectiveness of my story would be to see how effective individuals who otherwise do not feel strongly about social issues or appear to be comparatively less aware of them respond to it. So, I tried to include the responses for these two kinds of individuals, at the least.

### Interview script

Q1. At first glance, what do you think this story is about?

Q2. Do you think the story flows properly from phrasing the situation, to how it has progressed, and to its conclusion?

Q3. Do you think the story was effective in communicating the intended key message?

Q4. Did you feel the call of action was justified and appropriate?

Q5. Was there anything that resonated well with you in the story? If so what and if possible, why?

Q6. What improvements would you suggest?

### Findings from the Interviews - Responses

#### Q1. At first glance, what do you think this story is about?
Answer 1. "This story appears to be about the disparity between the very rich and the very poor."

Answer 2. "I think the story intends to convey a comparison between the poor, who cannot afford to eat well and the ultra-rich, but the first visualization shows the world food insecurity in the context of the recent pandemic, which makes me think that this comparison is a pre and post pandemic times."

Answer 3. "It seems like the presentation is trying to communicate the level of hunger in the world through the lens of the wealthy." 

#### Q2. Do you think the story flows properly from phrasing the situation, to how it has progressed, and to its conclusion?
Answer 1. "The story flows fine, although the call of action seems abrupt to ask for donations first and then present the petition." 

Answer 2. "I like the flow of the story in how food security is discussed first, then the growth in the wealth of ultra-rich, and then a connection is established between the two. The conclusion could have been better, maybe a section highlighting the negligence of the ultra-rich to global problems could add more weight to the argument."

Answer 3. "The first three visuals had me hooked. I thought the breakdown was very impressive. It allowed me to absorb the content very easily. Especially since the first two graphs talk about the World Food insecurity and the growth of the wealthiest before the pandemic. The third visual brings it all together in terms of the impact the pandemic has had on both variables."

#### Q3. Do you think the story was effective in communicating the intended key message?
Answer 1. "If the intended message was that the very rich are well placed to resolve world food insecurity, then yes it was."

Answer 2. "I think the message is being communicated well. However, there is a need to add clearer titles to show what each section conveys."

Answer 3. "The story, definitely, took me on a roller coaster ride. It made me feel concerned, angry and instigated to take action all at once."

#### Q4. Did you feel the call of action was justified and appropriate?
Answer 1. "Again, the call of action with the petition seemed more appropriate than a donation for someone like me. But I do think putting the link to donation helps as well, for something like food insecurity. It helped that it was a reputable transnational body like UN Food Program you were asking donations for."

Answer 2. "The call to action does not seem to be connected with the rest of the story. Where are the ultra-rich involved here?"

Answer 3. "The call of action is justified. However, I would like to see some more context and other actions individuals can take to play their part in ending world hunger."

#### Q5. Was there anything that resonated well with you in the story? If so what and if possible, why?
Answer 1. "Certainly! The idea of zooming in to see the proportion of wealth of the richest person and the richest in the world really drove the idea home for me."

Answer 2. "The conversation about the ultra-rich is much talked about. It’s interesting to see how the wealth they own could help solve a major world crisis."

Answer 3. "The visual showing the “petty change” and its significance for ending world hunger versus its value for the rich was very powerful."

#### Q6. What improvements would you suggest?
Answer 1. "Maybe a comparison of how the world economy has fared in the pandemic with richest in the world, to show how the latter's growth of fortunes is so important to understand."

Answer 2. "I think adding a few interactive visualizations and possibly making segregate sections could improve the overall structure of the story."

Answer 3. "I’m excited to see how the visuals sketched to represent proportions will turn out. They might take this entire story to a whole new level. In terms of improvement, I would add more text and phrase the story in a way that leads to the call of action in a more cohesive manner. Other than that, the flow is very smooth and what you are trying to communicate is crisp and clear."

#### Key findings from the feedback

There were some recurring ideas in the feedback I received that I have included in the following section. Some aspects of the story appeared to be lacking, that could add to the story. The flow of the story also appears to need to some work, that especially the transitions from one distinct section to another within the story. Additionally, there were some suggestions for the call of action section in particular - where there was a need for addressing the relevant audience and demanding an action relevant to them was suggested. These are some of the key ideas that I will be focusing on while working on the final story.

### Improvements/Changes to be made

1) Comparison of the income paid in taxes, common people and the ultra-rich.
2) Comparison of the growth of the private sector or generally the economy during the Pandemic, with the change in wealth of the wealthiest during the pandemic.
3) Address the disconnect between the header and the first visualization - add sub-header that connects with the pandemic angle.
4) Make sure there is appropriate segregation of sections in the story.
5) Make sure that the call of action connects better with the rest of the story.
6) Include the petition of the in the call of action before the donation button and section.
7) Look for appropriate images, that complement the story.
8) Add more text or information to explain the story.
