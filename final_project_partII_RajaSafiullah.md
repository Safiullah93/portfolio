# Final Project - Part II

## Storyboard and wireframing

Here is the link for the Storyboard. For the storyboard, I used Shorthand. The primary reason for using shorthand was that it allows for a nice way to put palceholders for text, images and visualizations, and try to get a better sense of how the story might flow and appear to my audience. This helped me a lot with my user research, where all of the story could be seen in its entirety and allow my audience to easily respond to it. 

## User Research

### Target Audience

The target audience of the story are common people for me who have the ability mobilize and voice concern over the ever increasing disparity in fortunes of the richest and the most vulnerable in the world. The idea was to show to them how much of an impact the richest can make in the lives of the common people across the world, with an almost insignificant proportion of their wealth. And if there is a conviction on their part to make a positive contribution in terms of resolving world food insecurity, then there is minimal effort reuquired form their end. My audience can be better informed on this situation, and act accordingly to possibly stimulate postive action from the richest in the world.

### Approach to identifying individuals to interview

The approach was to look for individuals who might already be socially active and interested in social issues like World Food Insecurity. Secondly, a better measure for the effectiveness of my story would be to see how effective individuals who otherwise do no feel strongly about social issues or appear to be comparatively less aware of them respond to it. So I tried to include the responses for these two kinds of individuals, at the least.

Q3. Do you think the story was effective in communicating the intended key message?

Q4. Did you feel the call of action was justified and appropriate?

Q5. Was there anything that resonated well with you in the story? If so what and if possible why?

Q6. What improvements would you suggest?

### Findings from the Interviews - Responses

#### Q1. At first glance, what do you think this story is about?
Answer 1. This story appears to be about the disparity between the very rich and the very poor.
Answer 2. 
Answer 3.

#### Q2. Do you think the story flows properly from phrasing the situation, to how it has progressed, and to its conclusion?
Answer 1. "The story flows fine, although the call of action seems abrupt to ask for donations first and then present the petition." 

#### Q3. Do you think the story was effective in communicating the intended key message?
Answer 1. "If the intended message was that the very rich are well placed to resolve world food insecurity, then yes it was."

#### Q4. Did you feel the call of action was justified and appropriate?
Answer 1. "Again, the call of action with the petition seemed more appropriate than a donation for someone like me. But I do think putting the link to donation helps as well, for something like food insecurity. It helped that it was a reputable transnational body like UN Food Program you were asking donations for."

#### Q5. Was there anything that resonated well with you in the story? If so what and if possible why?
Answer 1. "Certainly! The idea of zooming in to see the proportion of wealth of the richest person and the richest in the world really drove the idea home for me." 

#### Q6. What improvements would you suggest?
Answer 1. "Maybe a comparison of how the world economy has fared in the pandemic with richest in the world, to show how the latter's growth of fortunes is so important to understand."

### Improvements

1) Comparison of the income paid in taxes, common people and the ultra-rich.
2) Comparison of the growth of the private sector or generally the economy during the Pandemic, with the change in wealth of the wealthiest during the pandemic.
